# Recursion Project

This project is based on the [Recursion lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) from The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. It explores recursive algorithms through practical implementations.

## Overview
The project involves building recursive functions to solve common programming challenges. The focus is on understanding recursion fundamentals, such as base cases and recursive cases.

## Features
- Recursive problem-solving techniques
- Implementations of classic algorithms like factorial, Fibonacci and merge sort
- Practice with edge cases and optimization
